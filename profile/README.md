### Work with us

Transactions on blockchains move value from one account to another. Smart contracts control when these funds are moved.

We think that such transaction events can be applied to more use cases:
* drive business processes ü§∏
* share a secret üîë
* voting üó≥Ô∏è
* messaging ‚úâÔ∏è
* gaming ‚ôüÔ∏è

.. and many more

We are in the process to setup communication channels to capture these events in realtime and distribute them to downstream processes.

We offer our data services with these features:
- fast and predictable
- reliable and trackable
- affordable pay-per-usage
