# BCA - Blockchain Data Analytics

Blockchain projects use transactions to move value from one account to another. Smart contracts control when these funds are moved.

We think that such transaction events can be used for more:
* drive business processes 🤸
* share a secret 🔑
* voting 🗳️
* messaging ✉️
* gaming ♟️

.. and many more applications

We are in the process to setup communication channels to capture these events in realtime and distribute them to downstream processes.

We aim to provide our data services with these features:
- fast and predictable
- reliable and trackable
- affordable pay-per-usage

Stay tuned 🚀
